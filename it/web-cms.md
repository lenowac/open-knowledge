# Some Web Content Management Systems

Need a website, but don't want to code and need to collaborate with others? Sounds like you want a CMS!

A heavy CMS is great for anything that will have lots of sites and needs user roles. A light CMS is a great way of minimizing the server impact. An SSG is the most minimal setup, has a completely different workflow, but with an admin GUI or CI it can be well worth a try, even for not computer savvy people.
